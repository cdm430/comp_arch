Final design switch configuration

For successful simulation of our working design of a processor, 
all switches must be set to 1 (0001), including enable signals
for the Logic Units to allow the LU to carry out an AND operation.
The Right Shift requires a control in of 0011, therefore the switch
is configured this way.
